# Employment Details

## July 2016 - Present: Claranet Limited (London)

:: *Cloud Practice Director*

As the Cloud Practice Director, I am responsible for the entire cloud
engineering team of 40+ engineers across all supported cloud platforms
(Azure, AWS, GCP, VMware) as well as Cloud Economists and Learning and
Development.

My focus has been to grow the Cloud team whilst creating and evolving a
culture that is aligned to the purpose, values and goals for the
business.

:: *Technical Principal (CloudOps)*

This was a combined management and delivery role. I managed the initial
team of 8 engineers, as the Technical Principal. I was much more engaged
across the multi-cloud portfolio (Azure, AWS and GCP) supporting the
expansion and definition of new service offerings to customers.

:: *Azure Practice Lead*

With a Windows team already established I took on a new role to build
and grow the team and capability with Microsoft Azure. This was a very
entrepreneurial/leadership role within the business where I was leading
all elements of the business growth including hiring the team, partner
management with Microsoft and pre-sales with C-level customer prospects.

:: *Windows Cloud Practice Lead - Bashton Ltd*

I joined Claranet just 6 months after the acquisition of Bashton Ltd -
their first acquisition for public cloud capability. The initial
expectation of this role was to build a team to support the deployment
and on-going support of Windows infrastructure and applications on AWS.
