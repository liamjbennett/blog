As Deputy CTO my role is to focus on our digital strategy, including
products services and the tools we use to deliver them. This includes

As Head of Portfolio Architecture I was responsible for the architecture
and tooling underpinning all of Claranet UK’s portfolio of services.
This includes supporting the definition of services, working with
vendors and managing budgets for the investment in tools and in-house

all elements of the business growth including hiring the team, partner
management with Microsoft and pre-sales with C-level customer prospects.
