## The joy of first discovery

My history with puppet (link to first post)
Hacking on windows and getting my first job
Finding my community

## The difficult middle years and signs of the end

K8s, puppet 7 and 8, bolt
I disappeared from the community
Chef got bought
Puppet got bought

## What's next

Is it dead? Does it still have a place? 
What about Ansible? IBM + Terraform
Where is IaC in general?
