## Why I started Weeknotes

Weeknotes are like a work journal, a personal journal, a micro-blog and occasionally a brag document all rolled into one.

After reading [this post]() about weeknotes and then following #weeknotes on mastodon for a few weeks I decided that I would give it a go. I've had a go at journaling in its many forms before but it's never really stuck, but I though maybe this time by writing in public it might keep me going. 

When I started blogging again this year, I really got the love of it again. Well maybe not so much the writing and editing part but the getting ideas out of my head and into the world part. I also found that the habit of writing was actually good for my creativity - so maybe weeknotes would just be more of that.

## What I discovered

* It became self-fulfilling - drove ideas
* The more I wrote the more I wanted to

## What's next
* Less structure, more content
* Different parts of the site.
