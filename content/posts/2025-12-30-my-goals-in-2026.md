As I look forward to 2026, I am expecting plenty of work changes, but also some consistency as I continue to progress on all those things started in 2025. 

2026 is the year I turn 40 years old, so it is expected that I'll be a little more reflective, a bit more focused on who I want to be over the next decade and therefore I expect new goals to emerge over time but here are a few to get the year started.

## (1) Be consistent
The starting point should always be that the goals and habbits from the previous year.

## (2) Focus more on health and fitness
* Waking earlier
* Walking target - 8000/day (in blocks of X)
* Abs + Strength - 20m

## (3) Add more personal things to this blog
* Experimenting with new post types or "little and often" approach.
* 1 blog per month
