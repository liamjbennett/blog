I have been fortunate enough over the past few years to to have some excellent coaching, some helpful mentors and one or two pretty good therapists. As a result I have been able to get to know myself quite well and as part of one of my goals of 2025 I want to do a little bit more sharing of my thoughts, my ideas and therefore more of myself in public.

So let's start at the beginning:

* [IKIGAI](/me/IKIGAI)
* [Values](/me/values)
* [Purpose](/me/purpose)
* [Goals](/me/goals)

Unlike some of the posts on this site, the pages linked above will be updated regularly (so more like a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/)) as I learn and grow both with age, experience and further coaching. I hope you find the content here useful and it helps you write some of the content like this of your own.
