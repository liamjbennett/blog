## Employment

### Feb 2014 - Present: OpenTable International Limited (London) - Senior Infrastructure Engineer
A Senior infrastructure engineer at OpenTable means supporting the datacenter operations and development teams to build new infrastructure and to automate the build and managment of existing legacy infrastructure.

During my time at OpenTable I have built a logging infrastructure from the ground-up (on AWS using ELK and Apache Kafka that can support 1B message a day), replaced multiple monitoring systems based on nagios with a single solution based upon sensu, applied config management to a wide range of systems both on windows and linux and helped to develop new tools to support standardized deployments on mesos.

A significant portion of this role has involed me liaising with and training development and operations teams both in London and in San Francisco. It also required communicating with all layers of management to ensure the successfull rollout of the projects.

A lot of this work have given me the opportunity to work and release a lot of code open source and build communities around that. I am now reasonably well known in the puppet community for my work with Windows and have had the opportunity to blog, give talks and podcast on the this and other subjects. Community evangelism is not something that is often though of as significant in an operations-based role but I have found it to be both enjoyable and beneficial on many occasions.

From April 2015 to date I have been leading my team in its projects and decision making. We reamin fairly autonomous within the organization, indenitying problems and providing solutions whereever we see value.

### June 2010 - Feb 2014: Mimecast Ltd (London) - DevTools Engineer
As a build and release engineer for Mimecast I worked with all teams within the business and directly with the CTO to introduce Continuous Delivery into the business. That continued to be my main focus as the engineering team grew from 20+ to 100+. As the maturity of the build and release process advanced my role changed to a more DevTools focused position.

I think a devops mentality was critical to a role like this and I had to make sure that I remain balanced in both my development and operations skill-sets. This means that I was involved in all aspects of software development lifecycle. I advised on component based architectures to help speed up the build/delivery process, I introduced and educated on new testing tools, and I implemented and improved the deployment and release processes. I was also the primary administrator for all pre-production environments both Linux (CentOS) and Windows (all versions) and made extensive use of configuration management (puppet) and monitoring tools (Opsview, Nagios, Munin) to achieve this. I have performed many large migration projects and was heavily involved in Mimecast's ISO 28000:2007 certification.

It was very much platform and language agnostic role and I go to work day-day with a wide variety of tools and platforms including Java, C# and Ruby on both Linux, Windows and all major mobile platforms. I continue to believe that it is hugely important to remain flexible and to be able to pick up new languages and skills as quickly and efficiently as possible.

### Feb 2009 - June 2010: Saga Holidays Ltd (Folkestone, Kent) - System Consultant
As a systems consultant for Saga Holidays my work was extremely varied, from Java development work to advising business stakeholders about upcoming ideas and technologies. As a developer I worked on Java systems, both client and server side. I was originally recruited for my swing development skills but extended my knowledge beyond this into unit testing, webservices and databases.

In addition, I found that I spent a considerable amount of time focusing on build and releasing issues. I moved the team from performing manual builds to a semi-automated process and I continued to work on this as they advanced further in the continuous integration maturity model. This has extended my skill set to cover the use of tools such as Jenkins/Hudson, Sonar and scripting technologies such as Ant, Ivy and Maven. This was a difficult process (due in part the then legacy codebase) and required code refactoring, education of other impacted teams and migration to new toolsets (including new SCM).

Saga gave me experience in bringing CI to a large organization and the various challenges both technical and cultural that are involved in that.

### Sept 2006 - Aug 2007: Nexor Ltd (Nottingham) - Placement Student
I had various roles during my year with Nexor as I rotated around a number of departments where I learnt Perl, C++ and a number of Testing and Development skills (including unix development and the use of vmware). I also gained experience in network administration and the implementation and maintenance of military standard email software.

This development experience, in addition to my time in testing, has given me experience of the full software development life-cycle as well as a consideration of everything that is required for ISO:9000 status. During this time I was trained by a external party in the practice of good customer service and I maintain that this is one of my strengths from the year.
