[@ryantomlinson](https://x.com/ryantomlinson) It’s because there are rarely quantitive metrics at all. Most of these transformations are as much about politics or meeting other objectives (cost, tick-box innovation) than actually changing the organisation. Maybe this year I’ll write some words on this and what I’m seeing.
