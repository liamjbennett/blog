[@barney_parker](https://x.com/barney_parker) Depends on the system. Something that is third-party, has already transitioned into the commodity or behind the line of visibility makes sense to outsource. An application that _is_ your business of course not. But then many folks arenâ€™t able to wardley map to make that decision.
