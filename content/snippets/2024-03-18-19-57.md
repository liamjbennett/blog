[@hazelweakly](https://hachyderm.io/@hazelweakly) thank you for talking about
this. My daughter was diagnosed a couple of years ago after we went through a
big struggle for support. I also admit it’s taken me longer than it should’ve
to educate myself about her needs. More people need to discuss these things
openly.
