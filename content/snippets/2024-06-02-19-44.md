[@patrickdebois](https://x.com/patrickdebois) [[@garethr](https://x.com/garethr)](https://x.com/garethr) An amazing achievement [[@garethr](https://x.com/garethr)](https://x.com/garethr) and a well earned break. DevOps Weekly was the first newsletter I subscribed to and was out there way before newsletters had its resurgence. 

I look forward to seeing what other things you get up to.
