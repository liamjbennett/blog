[@gBico](https://x.com/gBico) [@Azure](https://x.com/Azure) Are you seriously using this incident as leverage? The wording seems like it came from marketing. I'd like to see more detailed information come out from MS about the "optimizations" they have made because we're expecting all cloud providers to be effected in very similiar ways.
