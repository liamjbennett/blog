[@jtopper](https://x.com/jtopper) [@douglassquirrel](https://x.com/douglassquirrel) Chaos Engineering was one of the open space topics at [@DevOpsDaysLDN](https://x.com/DevOpsDaysLDN) today and it was agreed by the group that almost no one is actually doing it - so Iâ€™m very interested in your thoughts.
