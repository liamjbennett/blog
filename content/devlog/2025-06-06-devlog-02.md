One of the elements of me enhancing this blog as a place I spend more of my time, is to start looking at a [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) implementation to cross-post my social media posts. Although with a static site that's pretty difficult, so the implementation I've gone for is more posting to all at the same time, using iOS Shortcuts. You'll start to see some of these already at [/snippets](/snippets).

So here is the logic:
1) Select which social social media sites to post to;
2) Ask for post text
3) If images shared from share sheet then upload to Dropbox
4) Post to social media sites (seperate shortcuts)
5) Get links for each social media post
6) Construct markdown file for snippet (using links to socials in metadata)
7) Use [WorkingCopy](https://workingcopy.app/) to post to site.

I also made heavy use of [datajar](https://datajar.app/)

Here are my shortcuts:
