Documenting a purpose or "your why" is a strong signal of self understanding that allows you to connect all other values, goals and objective to a single over-arching reason. It it a powerful anchor that sustains motivation over time.

This page not not documents my purpose statement and my ever-evolving iterations of it's language, but also all my notes on those iterations in the hope that other find that detail useful in coming to their own statement.
