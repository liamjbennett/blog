The story of a week told in 30 minuite increments. Flies past but with a few things to keep me motivated.
<p/>

* 🏛️ - This week I had a bit of time working on some public sector oppertunities. Starting with dipping my toe into our G-Cloud 15 submission and secondly working on a RFP for a public sector organisation. What I like about these is really how structured they are, how unusual and unique the oppertuntities can be vs the private sector and how surprisingly all the MSPs and GSIs that work with local and national government seem to be from the same 30-40 companies. I'll be keeping close to these, because I still think I have a lot to learn about this sector.
<p/>
 
* 🌧️ - I spent some time working on our AWS strategy. Our relationship with AWS has always been a rocky one, sometimes loved, sometimes ignored. This week's [redundancies](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2ywzxlxnlo) also haven't helped, having an impact on the partner organisation and thus sales. Despite that, I need to be customer focused and not AWS focused, so we started discussing the plan for better supporting customers with AWS. Lots of plans a foot, and a big focus on security and resliance - so let's see that happens this time around.
<p/>

* 🚀 - I've been building and investing in internal tools at Claranet for many years now, ensuring that both our engineering and customer experience continue to improve. In 2025, we built lots of features into the platform to support assessments, migrations and managed services, but not all customers got the benefit of that. This week I started speaking with the team about the programme of work to roll out all these features to all of our customers. It's a huge piece of work but I want to ensure that the future is indeed evenly distrubuted.
<p/>

* 🐾 - My bank balance has taken a bit of beating this week due to vet visits for the large dog and having my roof repaired. Turns out domestic life was also as busy as my work life this week.
