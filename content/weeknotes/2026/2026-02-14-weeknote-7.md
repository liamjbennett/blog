More meetings, more bids, more vets visits.
<p/>

* 🏢 - This week started with new internal governance sessions for the management team. One commerical, one opperational. Really focused on data, decisions and ensuring all senior managers are focused on the same priorities. Lots of lessons, but the biggest one being that data quality and access to data still remains an on-going concern. We made some good steps forward though and I'm looking forward to these future sessions every month.
<p/>
 
* 🧘 - I am spending more time with our pre-sales folks with 1:1s to gather information on how to improve our pre-sales experience. Pre-sales is one of the first interactions customer have with us and the ease and speed of these first interactions can make or break a relationship. There is also the goal to make pre-sales more efficient for the company and giving the pre-sales folks the right tools which will speed up customer acquision time.

* 💸 - I read four large RFI bid documents this week. This takes time, even with AI (because details matter) but it's also exciting. I look out for what I call "easter eggs" - the things that are unusual, difficult or require more discussion. Large oppertunities are the life blood of the business and can be a bit boring after a while, so I enjoy digging into one or two that have something we can learn from.

* 🐾 - My large dog had her surgery this week so some chaos has ensued, both practically and in the calendar - but all is well in the end.
