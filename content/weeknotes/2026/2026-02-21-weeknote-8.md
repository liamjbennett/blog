This week was one of low-level frustration as I run around gather information and then fighting with tools to improve my day-to-day workflow. Lots learnt, but annoying.
<p/>

* 🕵️ -  This week was dominated by working on a single public-sector framework bid. I've really learnt about the hard work our bid team goes through and how important it is to have up-to-date company information and case studies with rich meta data. I spent several hours this week, not only helping to answer some of the more complex questions but also running around helping fill some gaps in this bid content. Euqal parts boring, frustrating and educational. Lessons learnt, todo list added to.

* 🗃️ - I got to shadow a meeting this week between a customer and some of my german collegues talking about SAP. This is such a huge and specialist area and it was great to start at the beginning, see how our services are presented to customers so that I can work backwards, dig into the technical details and learn lots along the way. I'm coming across SAP more and more as I work with larger customers so this was a good starting point.
<p/>

* 🤖 - Like everyone these days I am viewing every tasks I perform in my role with the simple question - could this be automated and could AI do it? I have a few different AI tools avaliable to me, but as a manager the path of least resistance for a number of tasks is Microsoft Copilot. I spent more time than I should have this week with Copilot Studio trying to automate a series of tasks. I am not finished and I am left full of rage for this. There might even be a "I hate Copilot" blog post coming soon.
