Another week dominated by one project, but still time to learn a few thigns along the way.
<p/>

* 👔 - Project-R2 continues at pace, with this week starting the due-dilligence phase with another series of workshops. This was pretty time consuming but also very useful because it was much less sales-y than previous sessions and was more out getting specific questions answered. I feel more confident every day that this project might become a real deal.
<p/>
 
* 🏷️ - I spent quite a bit of time this week with our product, architect and finance teams planning the next interations of our service pricing. Lots and lots of edge cases and scenario-based planning. We're not done this in a while and we've had lots of example of difficult situations that we need to learn from in how we model.
<p/>

* 🕴️ - This week I learnt about the phrase "Total Experience (TX)" the combination of UX, DX and EX to provide wholistic customer outcomes. It has sparked so many ideas and something I want to write more about.
<p/>


📈 - This weeks stats:
* 726 minutes of podcasts
* 4485 average weekly steps
