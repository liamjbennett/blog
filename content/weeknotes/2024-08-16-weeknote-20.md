This week I have my product/portfolio hat on again while also taking some time to think about what's next.

* reviewing current product roadmaps (what's coming and what's ending) - pretty happy how it's coming together.
* re-reading my 2023+ technology strategy document - still stands up but probably needs a re-work in a few places. Should be updated annually.
* writing some scripts that help enable various cloud features we find useful when onboarding a new customer.
* following up on the AWS service deprecation debacle and putting together the plan.
* writing a new job description - it's been a while since I've done that. Every time I forgot how difficult it is to write a good one.
* started playing about with Copilot Studio - my brain is starting to fire with some ideas about where we can use this more.

Some other interesting things:
* [Automating against link rot](https://www.bentasker.co.uk/posts/blog/software-development/automatically-preserving-linked-urls-to-defend-against-link-rot.html) - use for a blog that's intending to be around for a while.
* [Neura Robotics new video](https://youtu.be/GE7VDgR_J1g?si=Gm9KGfqWBNjPIx2B)
