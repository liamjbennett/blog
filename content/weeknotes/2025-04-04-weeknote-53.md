Birthday week, time in front of the camera and thinking about UX.
<p/>

🌀 - Spent some time this week thinking through some requirements for our customer facing portals. It's part of my wider strategy to really enhance this customer interaction point while also maintaining a human feel for the service. This week has been filtering out ideas of functionality being developed across the business and how that might look and feel when presented to the customer in an integrated way. I don't put my BA/Product manager/design hats on often but when I do, it is something I enjoy.
<p/>

🎥 - On film twice this week, both internal, but one as we're rolling out some sales training for which I was involved in the webinar and secondly being professionally recorded by our brand team for some management training we're developing. Always good fun, preparing and running through these activities. Despite the serious topics, lots of laughs were had.
<p/>

🎁 - Birthday week. Which means my weekend will now be playing with my [Anbernic rg40xxv](https://anbernic.com/en-gb/products/rg-40xxv) and re-living my youth.
