This week was Sessions 6,7, and 8 of Project-R and some more portfolio planning and handling a customer business issue.

* Discussions have started about introducing the Digital Apps portfolio from the wider group into the UK. We've been doing everything from developing bespoke applications, modernizing applications onto new technology or building integrations and bots. This is all something that I want to bring to our UK customers and I've very excited to start working more in this space. Lots and lots more to come on this topic.

* I got to work on a customer separation this week - not something that comes up often but interesting when it happens. The customer in question was going through a divestment of part of their business and we were continuing to be responsible for the management of the environment for both organizations. Not just working with my legal and sales colleges, this also means supporting teams in updating systems and transitioning services - all without operational impact to the customer. One of those things that unfortunately has enough nuance to be difficult to automate.
