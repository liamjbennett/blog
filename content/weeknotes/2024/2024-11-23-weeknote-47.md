This week has been a very bumpy week with some exiting conversations but also some very difficult ones. I would say this is also one of those weeks where the incoming tasks and outweighed the completed. I've certainly earned by weekend's rest.


* Week started with follow-on from last week's RedShift issue - difficult conversation about cost of change. It was swiftly followed by [another escalation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaelbranney_oh-polly-online-womens-fashion-clothes-activity-7264721756949504000-wKyb) by which point I was already done for the week.

* I had some great conversations with Flexera about SaaS management. Really excited to be reaching out into the space more and exiting in some of the new things this unlocks for us and for customers. Lots more than just licensing management.

* Some time spent on our AWS root MFA, which has historically been a painful thing to scale and management. Some discussion based on the [recent announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/centrally-managing-root-access-for-customers-using-aws-organizations/) that this can now be centralised in the AWS Organisation. 

* Another week fighting Kusto query for some Azure reporting, this time for backups. Not great when all the documentations says AzureDiagnostics and the table doesn't exist. Another great one Microsoft, but something I resolved in the end.

* Enjoying digesting all the recent announcements from both [Ignite](https://news.microsoft.com/ignite-2024-book-of-news/) (most AI and Agents) and [Pre:Invent](https://aws-news.com/custom_feed/AdvXK) (root MFA and Aurora serverless scale-to-zero)

* Keeping me sane this week was the intense but always enjoyable [Bear Season 2](https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/series/the-bear/52m6nx7HoP5F) and the light relieve of binge watching [Only Murders in the Building](https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/series/only-murders-in-the-building/2EfP45PYWY5s) from the start.
