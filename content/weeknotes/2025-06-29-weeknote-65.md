"I learn in pictures, but I understand in words" ...

* â›¯ - I spend most of the week working on further portfolio writing, trying to get the first draft document completed before it goes off for further technical review and branding next week. The week concluded with the document done, and I'm pretty proud of the 15k words of it's contents. I learn quite a bit a long the way in putting it together and I already have plenty of ideas for Vol #2.

* ðŸ“„ - In later half of the week I spent continuing my work on the Service Design document from last week. This is another one of those tasks where I am learning more in the process of writing it than I thought I would at the start. My knowledge of ITIL is pretty good, but there are so many implementation details, subtlities and edge cases that it really does take a good bit of design work to establish something that provides a postive customer experience. Not finished yet, but not dreading it either.
