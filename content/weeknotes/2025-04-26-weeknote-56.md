I've been off this week for some R&R and to focus on a bit of house admin. So it will be a light weeknote this week.

* 🏠 - Spent some time focused on tidying the house, boxing things to move into storage and throwing things into a hired skip. Preparing the house ready to put onto the market. We've lived here for 8 years now so we're accumulated a lot. It will take longer than a week but it's a good start.
<p/>

* 📚 - I've also been reading a lot this week. That included not only catching up on a lot of articles but also reading some of the longer white papers I've been meaning to get to. I've also put a couple of magazines into my rotation which has been refreshing. I've been pretty bad at my fiction reading the past few months so I've spent some time catching up on that and I'm adding it to the stats part of the weeknotes so see how I get on.
