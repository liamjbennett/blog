This week has been one of an unsettling a chaotic work environment balanced out with some binge watching and listening for self-care (more than usual).

## What I’ve been doing

This week I've been rolling my sleeves up and helping unblock a few projects (again!). That's meant reviewing documents, writing for code again (it's been a few months) and lots of calls. Helicoptering in to fix problems isn't the best thing for an organisation but sometimes it's required.

It's been chaos and I have sometimes felt like I was chasing my tail but I have to admit it's felt good to work on things with a immediate payoff. It's been mostly AWS projects and it's been good to spend some time in the ecosystem again.

## What I’ve been thinking about

How all the acquisition of IaC tooling vendors ([the latest being HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-joins-ibm)) seem to get acquired around the 12-15 year mark (see: [my toot about this]()). Think I'll be buying some Pulumi shares when they IPO in the next 2 years.

The long-term impacts on [organisations that re-org every 2-3 years](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/07/29/the-curse-of-the-reorg-stop-overhauling-every-few-years-and-make-change-stick/).

## What I’ve been reading

Very little this week, but here are a couple of feeds added to my list that are less brain taxing a just, well, nice.

* https://basicappleguy.com/ - I'm a bit of a apple fanboy and this is one of those sites that very visually appealing as well as having some good content.
* https://alondoninheritance.com/ - This is one of many "history of London" sites, but the comparison photos here are a lovely introduction to I city I think is pretty cool.


## What I’ve been watching

* [Blue Lights - Season 2](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0f2cxpr/blue-lights) (BBC) - Police/Gang shows are my go-to TV genre of choice. Easy to watch, great set of characters. Set in Belfast which gives it a really interesting spin. Binged in a day. Here hoping this gets plenty more seasons.
* [Fallout](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fallout-Season-1/dp/B0CN4H661T) (Amazon) - Not being a gamer (for many years), I'm coming at this show with fresh eyes and few expectations. It's certainly not a watch-in-the background show as there is a lot to take in, both in terms of the script but also visually. Loving the premise and it's certainly not the dystopian show I was expecting.

## What I’ve been listening to

* [Unlocking Us](https://brenebrown.com/podcast-show/unlocking-us/) - the famous Brené Brown podcast is back and I'm just eating up all it's insights and wisdom. I never come way from one of these podcasts without something to think about or research further.
