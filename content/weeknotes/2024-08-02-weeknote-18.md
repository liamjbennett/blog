I have been on leave this week and taking a traditional camping holiday with the wider family. This is a combination of total chaos (as family events usually are) and a time to read and reflect.

It's the time when not only do I catch up on some fiction but also those long form articles that seem a bit too much after a long working week.

One thing I also like about the camping trips are the late night conversations around the fire. It's the time when you hear those stories about things that are most important and most impactful.

Anyway, as you'd expect there have been a few scribbles notes and tasks added to my second brain and my mind wonders free, so expect a few more blog posts and interesting little dev logs over the coming weeks about things I've been pondering.
