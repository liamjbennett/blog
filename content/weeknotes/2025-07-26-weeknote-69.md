This week turned out to be an unusually productive week. It was also a week where I was more in consume mode that production mode, spending more time reading and reviewing and less time writing than I am normally used to. This type of work is what has allowed a larger amount of treadmill steps this week that I would normally achive, but it has also resulted in me having consistently more energy.
<p/>

* üöâ - Monday started with a trip to Bistrol to visit a customer who's under-going an RFI. Some good challenging questions and I left a little unsatisfied but I also left with a small pocket full of ideas, so I can't complain.
<p/>

* üóÑÔ∏è - This week also contained one of the longest RFI's I've ever worked on, in this case for a financial services organisation. The usual basic spreadsheet of many questions was also sumplemented by a few hundred pages of additional content. All of this produced by our team and reviewed by me to bring it all together. It was an exciting one, and great to watch the team pull together for it, but wow! what a process. I actually hope we get through to RFP for this one because it'll be a hell of a ride if this RFI is the teaser.
<p/>

* üñäÔ∏è - If that wasn't enough, I thankfully managed to get more content for Project-R wrapped up. Like everyone at the moment, I'll be going on leave in a couple of weeks so this is a mini-crunch time to try and get as much finished and all the loose ends tied up as I can. Thankfully I had a lot of energy this week to plow through.
