Another week with an office visit and another week where I feel connected to all corners of the business. However I ended the week with whatever bug is doing the rounds 😷
<p/>

* 📈 - Another week with a big emphasis on sales. A combination of account planning, renewals and a few roadmap conversations with customers meant that overall it felt engaging, like we had some exciting plans and that some of our customers will continue to push us.
<p/>
 
* 🎟️ - My time in the office also allowed me to be part of another set of folks going through their induction to the business. Having given my usual 25 minutes on the products, our capabilities and the company, I got the usual around of questions. The questions are the reason I do it. We often hire other people from the industry and people with naturally ask questions in the context of where they have come from and their prior experience. This is great, because while answering their question I am also learning from them about their previous companies, products they are familiar with and a little about the people asking those questions. I will try and follow-up with the people asking the most interesting questions to get even deeper insight.
<p/>

* 🌱 - This week I spent more time with some of our project management team discussing ways to improve what they do and provide more context to the day-to-day decisions they make. I massively admire project managers, but they have a level of organisation that I don't naturally have. I've always surrounded myself with people that have this skill. In the sessions this week we discussed giving them better visibility of the overall finances of the projects and also the downstream impacts on movements in project tasks. We worked on improving dashboards and automating some of their worst admin tasks. I enjoyed really getting into the weeds with this team and it gave me a new found empathy for what they do.
<p/>

* 🔜 - With a focus on quarterly updates to our portfolio radar, this week has been focused on gathering and discussing all the latest updates. Plenty of new things going in and some exciting new roadmap items. Some won't quite make it this time around, but it's been a good exercise and I've enjoyed all the discussions. I suspect we'll release internally next week and to customers the week after, as per the previous agreed cadence.
