This week I am publishing the weeknote from my phone as I lay in a field on the annual family camping trip. Monday and Tuesday were still chaotic work days but the remainder has been some much needed down time.
<p/>

* 🔎 - Monday was spent with teams reviewing some internal processes, with a key focus on adding more automation between our security, risk, problem and incident management processes. I'm excited to see some of these things come into effect because we're seeing improvements to both customers and our front-line engineers.  
<p/>

* 🤝 - Tuesday was my last working day for a week and half so was all about emails and handovers. Thankfully, there is plenty of momentum on our projects at the moment and I've been much better as writing down ideas and guardrails more regularly so there was very little to handover. These are periods that help me observe the resilience of our tech teams, particularly during holiday periods.
<p/>

* 🏕️ - Wed-onwards is the annual family camping, an opportunity to read, write, catch up on a backlog of white papers and generally not do much. While this is a time for me to decompress, I also find it to be one of my most creative periods where I often end up with my notes app full of questions and ideas.
