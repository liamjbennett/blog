New people, new questions, new inspiration ...
<p/>

* 🚸 - Started the week with an introduction session with our new work experience folks. Giving a "this is what we do" presentation but without all the industry-speak was quite refreshing. The questions I got were inspiring and I really got a kick of out talking to these teenagers at the start of their journey. I really must do this more.
<p/>

* 🟢 - We're got a few batches of new joiners across the business over the next few weeks and I've been involved in their inductions. Presenting what the technology teams do is one thing, but I also got lots of general business questions which was fun. I don't think I ever get bored of these types of things. While I hope our new joiners get some useful knowledge, I also find that I get a good sense check of the rest of our process based upon the types of questions that get asked.
<p/>

* ⛯ - Starting a very specific set of activities on putting together our FY26 roadmap. This includes all elements, proposition, product and lifecycle management. This week I had a deep-dive session on proposition - that are the big bets we're going to make, what product bundling and what verticals we're targeting and why. Good conversation and useful output that customers will get to see at the end of the month.
<p/>

* 🏉 - The weekend is all about U12 Rugby - a full weekend away tour. Very loud, very busy, very fun. Quality family time.
