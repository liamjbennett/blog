Where did this week, go? My calendar was full but staring at it's multi-coloured hues I couldn't say for certain what my output was. What I can say, is that this week was more about keeping the rails on the track and supporting all of those around me.
<p/>

* 🧯 - Monday did not start on a good note, I had two escalations in my inbox to deal with and well, that pretty much set the tone for the whole week. Frustratingly while both different in their problem and from different customers they both had very similar themes: we didn't do X on time, we don't trust you have the skills to do X. While resolved by the end of the week, it was a cold-shower moment that it doesn't matter how good your service is or your skills are, if you your CX falls below the standard then trust gets chipped away and it takes 10x as long to fix that as it does the problem that caused it.

* 📄 - Project-R reached a big milestone this week. After a year of paperwork, documentation and building landing zones we've now migrated our first pilot machines. Still a big hill to climb but I'm going to sit here on this rock and take in the view for a couple of hours before getting back to working through the next series of challenges.
<p/>

* 🖍️ - We have two big bids on the go at the moment and I had some time blocked out to review the content. I have to say we're getting much better at responding to these types of things that we were even a year ago. I'm sure I'll be trotted out to give a "why Claranet" pitch soon enough - which I don't mind, because I genuinely believe what I'm saying, but sometimes I wish there were a few others as passionate about telling that story as I am.
<p/>

* 📓 - Project management is an MSP is a complicated beast. Multiple methods, multiple outputs, lots of different context to the various ways and means we implement it. Tasks, Estimates, Invoicing, Utilisation, resource planning. All complex, all messy. We're got lots of people at the moment expanding their use of the new Microsoft Planner. I've been using this myself for a few weeks but this week I've started exploring it's capabilities from a few different personas to see if it will work more broadly and help us deal with some of this complexity. As you'd expect it also has some Copilot integration, which at the moment I am a bit "meh!" about but we'll see in a couple of weeks if I few on this tool improves.
