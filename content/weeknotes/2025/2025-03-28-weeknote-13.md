It's been a year! I've managed to keep up this little weeknote habit for 52 weeks. For something that I thought would probably last a couple of months and then get deleted, I'm pretty happy with myself that I've got this far. There have been a few things I've learnt from this process, the main thing being is that there is quite a bit of repetition week-to-week because the projects and initiatives I work on typically take a lot longer than initially expected - planning fallacy right there! Anyway, I'm still enjoying writing these even if it's only me that's reading and reflecting on them.

* 💰 - Project-R - the beast of a project that dominated my working life and these weeknotes for the past six months, has finally signed. After the moment of excitement, now the real work begins. This is really my only note of the week as everything else has been wrapped around this, internal project calls, resourcing calls, internal kick-offs, tooling and systems calls, CapEx and procurement calls. It's been a sea of calls and the engine of this thing gets moving. As a five-year contract, this is coming to be something that dominates the years to come and I'm excited to find out all the oddities along the way.
