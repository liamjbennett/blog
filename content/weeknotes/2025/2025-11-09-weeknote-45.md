A week of R&R requires some much needed R&R...
<p/>

* 🧯 - Well the week started with an escalation on Project-R. Nothing really drastic but a combination of small problems which has led to an unhappy customer. Thankfully both sides had planned for such an eventuality and we had a well documented structure in place so we just had to follow the playbook. A good test I guess, even it does mean my calls will be starting at 8am for the coming days. A good reminder that even in projects you should plan for failure and have open discussions early on about how to handle it.
<p/>
 
* 🦾 - After receiving the RFP for Project-R2 at the tail end of last week, I decent amount of my week was further reading and planning. Lots of questions to ask and assumptions we'll need to make but it's definitely an interesting opportunity. Lots of people are worried about it though, so I'll be taking on the emotional labour of getting everyone though the process over the next few weeks. If we win this one (and it's a big if) then it's one of those "once a year" projects that will keep up growing. Exciting but exhausting.
<p/>

* 💬 - It was announced this week that there will be come upcoming changes in the business. Not impacting me or my role (so dodging that bullet this time) but we're moving to a more practice/business-unit based org structure. I think this is a very positive step forward. The discussions I had this week were about looking back on previous models and org structures including what worked well and what didn't and how we can make this change successful. I'll less cynical this time around and feeling pretty confident about this change and it setting up the right foundations.

* - 🏉 After a long week, on Friday we travelling into London to watch the [Harlequins Women vs Gloucester Women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuK5nbhaPXA) at the Twickenham Stoop. Only my second ruby game and I absolutely loved it. My daughter also got to meet England players Ellie Killdunne and Zoe Aldcroft, which was big highlight.
