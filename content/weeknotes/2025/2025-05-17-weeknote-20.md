A week of two halves for sure. One of those weeks where you look back and go "wait, did that just happen?"
<p/>

* 🇦🇪 - The most of this week was all about the [Dubai FinTech Summit](https://dubaifintechsummit.com/). I flew out on Sunday for this event we were sponsoring to talk to people on our stand. I was also there to do some panel discussions, community interviews and some dinners with some customers. I'd been preparing for a week for this but I really wasn't prepared for the experience. Dubai is like nothing else - in culture, in opportunity, in inspiration. Landed home on Wednesday and I'll be thinking about and discussing this for weeks to come. I'll be writing up a specific blog post on this shortly.

* ⛯ - Roadmap - part 2. Continuing on from the roadmap work in [weeknote #57](/weeknotes/2025-05-03-weeknote-57/) I spend the week working on the product roadmap for FY26. Current scope is just the one-year horizon view. I will expand on this over the coming weeks for the 3-5 year horizon views.
