This week definitely felt like a slower week, but perhaps that's just a bad comparison to last week. I managed to deep-dive into a few technical areas I don't usually touch and also take some time to step back and think about the next steps for the portfolio.
<p/>

* 🏛️ - A few times this week I found myself in topics about standards, compliance or regulations. This came up first as part of Project-R, but then also in two additional calls with customers. This included GDPR (and the DPDPA), PCI:DSS and the riveting handbook that is the FCA regulations. While I don't pretend to be an expert in these areas, they come up so frequently that I think our portfolio needs to highlight them a lot more than it does today. Good insight, much reflection.
<p/>

* 🚇 - I've had this niggling problem for a little while now about the best ways to visualise our portfolio to different stakeholders, especially when there is a lot of information to present. I could write a lot more words on this, maybe in a separate post, but on Tuesday I was reminded by one of my amazing marketing colleagues about the London tube map and how it solves this type of problem. I will certainly be thinking more about this for some portfolio representation in the future, but I also think I want to read more on its design, history and UX as it sounds fascinating.
<p/>

* 👐🏻 - I was reminded again this week that there are things I have been working on that are now in a state of maturity, that they can and should be delegated, and the importance of staff enablement. That could be something I've written, something I've automated or decisions I make. Just like the calendar de-frag, this is a bit of an individual-contributor defrag, making sure that my own contribution is more about others than myself. Thankfully I have a great team around me who always keeps me on my toes and reminds me when it's time, even if I forget occasionally.
