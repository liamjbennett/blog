Where did this week go? A mixed bag of all sorts and then it was the weekend.
<p/>

* 🪢 - Had all the team leaders for tech practice, together F2F this week. It was brief but it's nice to see everyone together discussing employee feedback and plans for the next FY.
<p/>

* 💡 - This week I started a series of career coaching sessions with a colleague who feels they are in a bit of rut. This is my opportunity to expand on my coaching experience, using existing tools and techniques from my own coaching experience. I'm not often on this side of the coaching table in such a formal/structured manner. On this occasion I'll get to explore if this is something I want to do more of in my career all the while helping someone else with theirs.
<p/>

* 🧹 - Project R ticks along, all while doing its best to fill my calendar. This week was a lot of running around the edges, dealing with small internal projects, providing clarity of the scope and potential changes and monitoring how well the discovery process is progressing.
<p/>

📈 - This weeks stats:
* 257 minutes of podcasts
* 9,703 average weekly steps
* 5 book pages read
<p/>

📺 - This weeks background entertainment:
