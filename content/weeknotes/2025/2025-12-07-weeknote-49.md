Another big Project-R2 week this week, but also really getting to know my new team much better and thinking about the future.
<p/>

* 🗣️ - The result of last weeks cruch time meant that a few of my 1:1s had to be pushed back a few days. I hate having to move 1:1s because I respect the time I spend with people and the mutual value of the sessions, however in this case, even if I could have shuffled things I don't think I would have been in the right mental state to support them the way they deserved to be supported. The knock-on effect of moving the sessions was the first two days of the week being jam-packed with 1:1s. Taking on a new team is not easy but I've certainly found it easier this time and I've learnt my lesson by giving myself 15m breaks between sessions that ensure I'm always bringing the right energy and focus to each session.
<p/>
 
* 👔 - Project-R2 didn't stop this week. With the RFP submitted last week, Thursday had a 4-hour presenation so the rest of the week was preparing for that session. Thankfully, it went very well. The debrief session back at the office overlapped with the start of the Christmas party and a couple of celebration drinks later and I was done. Emotionally drained, but the peak has been climbed. Friday has another presentation, but I was remote and it was significantly easier once we knew what to expect.
<p/>

* 🔮 - Friday was also a little bit of time to start thinking about my new role and thinking towards subsequent years had in store. Next week, I'll be putting pen to paper on my cloud strategy, thinking about travel to other Claranet group countries to collaborate on some shared initatives and also what my role and the practice might bring if aquisitions were on the table in the next 18-months (nothing yet - but the market looks interesting).
