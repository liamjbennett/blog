A new routines, a bit more energy, a bite more productivity and a few more ideas ...
<p/>

* 🏃🏻‍➡️ - If you've been paying attention for the past few weeks, you will have noticed that there has a marked decline in my step count since I acquired by manual treadmill. Well apparently this is quite common, but I was not happy about it. So I stated this week with a small change to my routine by getting up 1hr earlier to spend an extra hour on the treadmill, while watching something on Netflix, so I can get an extra 5k steps in. It's been great, giving me a bit more of a boost before work and with the double-win of getting to watch a few more TV shows on my list.

* 📙 - Work started with some time reviewing this year learning and development strategy. A bit focus this year is on structure and validation. We now have some really good role-based learning paths, a good LMS and the ability to track the programme. Next step will be to review progress monthly and ensure everyone has enough time in their week to spend on their development.

* 📄 - This weeks technical/orgaisational challenge relates to design documents. We're all done them, high-level designs and low-level designs are pretty typical in most of the work we do, sometimes to provide validation and reassurance (as we are an outsourced organisation) sometimes for compliance reasons. The most traditional downside to these documents in they age quickly. This weeks challenge was agreeing an approach where by these documents are kept up-to-date without the burden of daily versioning for every change. Lots more thoughts on this, both in terms of process and tooling. Maybe I should write another post on some of these things I've learnt.
<p/>

* 🥂 - The week ended with the sales kick-off, a time when I usually present one or two things and in return I get to have a lot of conversations and gather a lot of peoples ideas. I usually come away with a lost of notes and follow-ups and this week was no different. Great BBQ, great company, good end to the week.
