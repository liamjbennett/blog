A week of two halves ...
<p/>

* 🗃️ - I started the week, returning to my previous work of change catalogues. The main aim being to ensure we don't have any gaps, that all the things we manage have at least one known, standard change. There are a few gaps and it's a bigger job than I was expecting but given it's impact to all our customers it's a useful exercise. Still work to be done over the next few weeks on this.
<p/>

* 👦🏻 - This week we also had another intake of work experience people and I got the oppertunity to talk to them and answer their questions for a couple of hours. This was quite fun and I'm always amazed about the standard of kids coming out of mainstream education. I don't rememeber being as technically literate as they are now when I was their age, I was all energy and dive, but not as knowledgable that's for sure.
<p/>

* 🎭 - I had the pleasure of taking a nice mid-week day off to attend Tim Minchin's gig in Brighton. A picnic on beach, some cocktails and Ivy Asia and the gig in the evening. Honestly, wonderful and a break that I needed.
<p/>

* 🏢 - Friday was one of our company "Townhall" session, and I was in London presenting on portfolio and answering questions. The questions were good and it was commented how my presentations are always "animiated" which I'll take as a compliment. Take away from this is that I need to produce more content in different forms e.g. 1-pagers, small videos etc and that people want to hear more about all the things we doing more often. Good insight and good end to the week.
