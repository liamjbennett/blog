Sometimes there are weeks that really push my mental resilience, testing how far I can stretch my abilities to multi-task, prioritise and still ship things. This is one of those weeks. I can confidently say I left nothing on the table.
<p/>

* 🪆 - Project-R2 continues to be the gift that keeps on giving. Asked to build a dedicated team for the opportunity, it really means looking at building an MSP inside an MSP. Engineering, Support, HR, Finance, all elements are being considered. Good exercise, but getting in all written down and actually filling out the RFP responses continues to drain and be impacted by the occasional executive dysfunction.
<p/>
 
* 🗓️ - A highlight of the week was a single session with a customer, where they discussed their project roadmap for the year and I had the opportunity to discuss our roadmap and how it aligns with what they are trying to do. I do these types of sessions all the time but it's rare to get such great insight and transparency from a customer and both parties left very satisfied.
<p/>

* 🧢 - Last week I mentioned that new organisational changes had been announced. On Wednesday, after candidates for the new Director of Cloud Practice dropped out of the running, I was asked to step into the role on an interim-basis. While I had done a similar role and with an almost identical title four years ago, this role is a bigger role and comes with the budget responsibility that my previous role did not. I was asked to come into the role on a interim basis with the longer-term intention of taking on the role if both I and the company can make sufficient provision over the next few months for some of my existing responsibilities. It is an exciting opportunity and I look forward to getting back in the weeds with the cloud engineers and the customers they are supporting.
