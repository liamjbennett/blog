Crunch week. No avoiding it, this was a tough one. 3 days in the office, one evening working into the early hours of morning but it's over now and I can take a couple of days rest before the next stage starts. Did I mention it's only 2 weeks until I'm on leave for Christmas?!

* ⚰️ - Project-R2 is out the door. The RFP response got completed with superhearo manuvers from several people working right up until the submission deadline. It was the reason for my office visits and took over 95% of my week. There are mixed feelings about this one. Scary/Exciting if we win it, but also Sad/Releaved if we don't. Either way, next week follows with the presentation stage right until January - more work ahead.

* 👐🏼 - The only other notable highlight this week was that I had a good session meeting my team leaders face-to-face for the first time. It was important to spend this time together and hear there thoughts, opinions and prirorities. There is a good mix of voices in the room and I think with the right structure we can really make a big change. Genuinely excited. It's this team and this new role that is keeping my motivated when everything else is a big struggle.
