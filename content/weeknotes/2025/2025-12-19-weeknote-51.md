First week of my 3 weeks of leave, I have mostly been focused on ... nothing much. Decompressing from a pretty stressful couple of months of work means that this week is binge watching lots of tv and movies, catching up on reading articles, whitepapers and some books and trying not too think about too much work.

What that means is my background entertainment section below is larger than usual, I'll be shortly adding a few more entries to [/bookmarks](/bookmarks) and there I'll be spending a day next week drafting one or two blog posts for the coming year.

📈 - This weeks stats:
* 476 minutes of podcasts
* 6,327 average weekly steps
* 49 book pages read (1984 - p99-148)
