A quick one this week and not my usual weeknote. I spent this week in on a work trip to Chamonix, a seasonal work event that used to take place every year but hadn't been done since 2019 and has now been brought back. This is the time of year when I spend the most time with my peers from other countries and I value every second of it.
<p/>

* 🎿 - The days are spent skiing in the morning, followed by workshops and other team-based activities until the late evening. Almost every minute of the day, from breakfast time, taxi transfers and workshop agendas is tightly organised, and with 30 people there that is somewhat of a miracle.
<p/>

I came back dehydrated with aches, pains and bruises but with a long list of ideas and a schedule of other sessions to work through upon my return.
