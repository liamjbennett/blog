It's Christmaaaaaaas! Well, that's about it really and rightly so. 

The traditional large family events on the 26th and 27th - 20 people squeezed into our house. 

Managed to catch up on some reading and binged watched [Bad Sisters](https://www.apple.com/uk/tv-pr/originals/bad-sisters/).

Expect a little more next week.
