Project-R continues to be a significant theme of my weeks, however this week was mostly focused on ensuring the best service experience so I can't complain too much about that. I will however compain about having to give the best version of myself while it's 27+ degrees in rooms without aircon. 🥵
<p/>

* 📄 - My week started working on Project-R working with the customer of their service design document. This is actually a lot more interesting than it sounds. The purpose is to take what's in the contract, which can be seen as the red-lines of the service and start having deeper conversations about what they want the experience to look and feel like. It mostly involves conversations about scenarios, edge cases, previous experiences and KPIs. All of this then get's written down in a document that is shared and can be updated over time as both parties learn to work together.

* 🧩 - On Wednesday I went to Leeds for our first face to face meeting for Project-R. This is the first time I had met the customer representatives F2F despite having worked with them almost daily for the best part of a year. I really found it a useful experience and I'm reminded that whatever the distance that needs to be travelled, meeting people in-person with some regularity builds relationships that can help during difficult times. Don't ever skip this stuff.
<p/>

* 🤹 - I would say the week ended on a bit of a down note. Not because anything went wrong but because I had two days of near back-to-back meetings where 50% of them were 15-20 minute status update or decision meetings. Not in itself a problem, I love to see a 15m meeting vs the default 30m as it really focuses everyone, however when they are back to back it can we quite wearysome.
