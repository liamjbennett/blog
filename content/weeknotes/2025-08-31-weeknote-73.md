While the theme of this week is mostly working through reading and drafting customer documents, I've been exploring a few back-to-basics things that will improve services for our customers.
<p/>

* 🪛 - Like most MSPs we're a big ServiceNow user. However, I'll admit, despite having spent about 8 years using it almost daily I've only really started to explor all it's features, all it's modules and it's it's automation and workflow possibilities over the past few months. This week I started being a bit more deliberate about my learning/digging. Document management, vendor management, GRC, maintenance and blackout windows, business rules. Scribbling notes and scheduling demos.

* 🌊 - DR sceanrio planning with a customer. One of our customers have recently been acquired and as is often the case in this sceanrio, we end up on calls with the new acquiring organisation walking them through that we do, details of the contracts and areas of reponsibility - typical due-dilliance stuff. This week, I got the oppertunity to sit in on one of these calls, specially focused on DR (as I'm paying more attention to this topic at the moment) as the customer asked questions we went through a number of different scenarios. Really though-provoking stuff actually. Access loss, randomware, macilitious actor, force majeure events, testing frequencies. I let my team do the talking, I was just there to scribble notes and think about how we can improve our service for this customer (and all our DR customers) later.
<p/>

* 👷🏻 - You'd think that after decades of running customer projects that this would be an area of pure standardisation with little to re-think or innovate - well you'd be wrong. I've been observing how we deliver different types of projects for some time. Different scenarios, different enagement models, different team structures - I think we run them all at different times. I'm been thinking a lot more about it this week and trying to put those thoughts into words. I expect that those internal documents may resurface summarised in a blog post here at some point.
