This week has been with 3-days in London, 2 for work and 1 for pleasure.

* Started the week on Project-R content, more questions, more content to write.

* 1st day in London presenting to sales on the latest Q2 cloud offerings. It's amazing just how many opportunities there are and how many customers still haven't migrated or have migrated and are still running their cloud environment like an old datacenter. I love these types of sessions because I get some fresh perspectives and great questions.

* 2nd day in London on the first customer presentation for Project-R. There are 10 sessions with the customer for this project. Never had anything like this before as an RFP - but it's exciting and it's these types of thins that make you grow as a company (and as an individual for that matter!)

* Thursday was a tale of two-halves. Our Sharepoint online instance almost ran out of space so there was an urgent task of backup, archive and consolidation work to to done. This urgency was balanced out by a clam evening spent in London watching [Tim Minchin at Guardian Live](https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-events/article/2024/jul/08/in-conversation-with-tim-minchin-live-in-london-and-online) for the launch of his new book.

* The remainder of the week was more Project-R sessions, both internal and with customer.

* Watched [Star Trek Discovery - S04](https://www.paramountplus.com/gb/shows/star-trek-discovery/) to keep me sane.
