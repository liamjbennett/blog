This week had some good news and the I had so many meetings and adhoc calls I couldn't really tell you what day it was. Overall though this week is a quick weeknote as there was only a couple of key things really going on this week.

* üöå - Got verbal confirmation from the CEO that Project-R is going ahead. This meant the week was full of calls preparing everyone for what's to come, introducing people to the project who haven't been involving and getting engineering assigned to the engagement. With a project of this size this also meant ensuring everyone was calm, despite the challenges, and hopefully they fed off my confidence.

* ‚öôÔ∏è - Had come great conversations with our internal systems teams this week. I never forget how important it is for our internal systems to be treated in the same way as our customer projects, so I had some roadmap conversations with each of the internal systems teams this week about improving CX, better integration and adding some functionality that's going to have a massive impact on the engineering experience for delivering Project-R. This includes improvements to our CMDB, our migration tooling and our customer portal.

üì∫ - This weeks background entertainment:
