* 🪂 - Tuesday I was meeting a customer in Manchester. It was a sales meeting, but one to a very technical audience so very much no B*S. It was a session that could have stalled the relationship just as easily as it could have extended it. It didn't go exactly as expected but we walked away with not one, but two oppertunities. Just reminds me that somestimes despite hardwork and plenty of relationship building, a touch a luck also helps.

* 🔑 - PIM and PAM are two staples of secure access management to customer environments. This week I had to faciliate a discussion on our PIM implementation for access to our AWS customer environments. A 6-step process, spanning 3 systems. Yes, it's secure and yes it's the right thing to do but the engineer-experience of actually having to access systtems is more than a bit painful. If this isn't the death of ClickOps I don't know what will be.

* 🗃️ - This week I also started expanding on the topic of our Change Catalogue. A core element of any managed services portfolio, this week I faciliated some conversations about expanding our change catlogue, automating more of it and talking to customers about moving more change into standard click-button changes. 

* 🎢 - RFPs. That sometimes out of nowhere sales activity that typically involves filling in a spreadsheet with hundreds of questions. I have a love/hate relationship with these things. I hate the ones copy-n-pasted from three different RFPs aimed and three different types of organisations - it's just lazy procurement. I hate the ones that want you to do design work for free. I love the ones that ask difficult or awkward questions that force me to look at how we operate and I love the ones that include requirements for large parts of our porfolio because it makes me think about how it all fits together. This week was only one portfolio item, and I had two days to do it, but it was well written and I learnt some stuff doing it.
