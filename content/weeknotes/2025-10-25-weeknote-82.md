Another week that was completely unlike the previous ones, with my having lots of different hats on from sales, finance and engineer. Certain keeps things interesting and a few new things to build on over the next couple of months.
<p/>
 
* 📋 - I've been bending my brain thinking, planning and learning about knowledge management and document management. At the current time, like many other MSPs our knowledge management is diverse and inconsistent. This week I am been on a deep-dive to re-design our approach; thinking about documents, versioning, approvals, docuemntation and code, documentation in git repots, documentation in wikis and how to handle keeping things up-to-date where there is complex representations like tables and diagrams as well as text. I am in the process of writing this all down so that others can contribute to the new strategy. More plans to come.
<p/>

* 🎙️ - In the middle on the week, I delivered two sessions of a webinar on our portfolio. It covered both the topic of my previous blog on [why I hate product roadmaps](https://www.liamjbennett.me/posts/2025-09-06-why-i-hate-product-roadmaps/), Claranet's alternative to roadmaps and some of our upcoming focus areas. There has been quite a bit of prep for this over the previous week and I enjoyed working with my collegue Tom to present this - the back of forth always fun and making each session and slightly new experience. It's been a while since I last delivered a webinar - I forgot how anxitious I get in the build up but also how much I enjoy it in the moment.
<p/>

* 📈 - One of the lessons learned from working on large projects (like Project-R) is that how the project is constructed into deliverables, milestones and invoicing. It is a critical aspect and just as important as the solution itself. The middle of the week I spent re-viewing this again and ensuring that there are structures in play that are fair to both parties and that this is something we can take into future projects.
<p/>

* ⛅ - I ended the week with an internal project kick-off for working on IBM Cloud. Yep - IBM. In a few months, when we have progressed more with it, I will do a little write up on the rationale here, but the sort description is that IBM have asked us to support the platform and they have lots of customers they are trying to keep on IBM Cloud or move to IBM Cloud as part of existing enterprise licensing agreements. This is a similar to the Oracle playbook of a few years ago. This is not just a tactical/oppertunitstic move on our part but also part of a wider strategy to focus more on enterprise customers.
