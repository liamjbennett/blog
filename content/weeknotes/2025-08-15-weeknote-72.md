Having a week and a half off work typically means consuming content and letting my mind wander. This week was no different and you'll be able to notice from my usual weekly stats that I have certainly consumed more than my usual numbers. It was also been a week of odd jobs that let my mind wander and for ideas for form. I can image that the first few days back to work next week will involve turning all my scribles in my note app and on random bits of paper into actions and more interesting content.
<p/>

* 🏕️ - Monday and Tuesday were the tail end of the weekend of camping. A great oppertunity to just sit in a field, read some books and catch up with family. It was also a good time for some walks and letting my brain digest a few things while in few surroundings. I didn't take my laptop, but I certainly felt the craving to write more while I was there.
<p/>
 
* 📖 - On my return from camping, I spent a day just catching up on some content that I had been meaning to read for a while. This included a good handful of white papers, some longform articles and some videos, all of which I rarely have time to consume in my usual week. Lots of notes written, starting to form these together into some bigger things, but I've been reminded the that my [/bookmarks](/bookmarks) isn't a full as it should be and I'm doing a bad job at sharing. Must fix.
<p/>

* 🧹 - I also spent a couple of days doing a spring clean on the house. While this seems like the most mundane of weeknote ancidotes (it is!), it is also the time where I managed to switch my brain off and consume far more podcasts than I would usually (about 3x as much). I can't say that all the podcasts on my [/podroll](/podroll) give me ideas and recommendations every time but I would say it's something like one in every 10 hours, I just don't know which 10.
