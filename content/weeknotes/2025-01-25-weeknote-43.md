More words, more films, more questions ...

* üìú Project-R continues to extract words from my brain like silvery strands from a Harry Potter memory charm. This week was a quick 10k words of contractual text describing our managed services. Definitions, obligations, we will do this, we may do this, we require you to do this other thing from time to time. I don't know how lawyers do this every day - exhausting. Having said that I did spend some time writing a couple of use AI prompts, one which reviews my work and the other which drafts definitions for me. Not perfect to useful and certainly re-usable.
<p/>

* ‚öôÔ∏è I was also involved in a customer presentation on Tuesday which included demos as well as the usual barrage of questions. Having lots of questions I can understand, people want to know what they are buying, but it's rare for customers to want to see demos of how we do what we do. I was thinking more about it as we were preparing for it and I really couldn't understand why some customers want to see behind the curtain of a service they are buying and want to see how we deliver services to them and what tools we use. When was the last time you got on a call with your electricity company and asked - can you show me exactly how you get that power from the wind turbine to power my TV and can you show me all the tools?
