This week as been a mixed emotions week. Sadness with departing collogues but also a week of positive productivity.

## What I’ve been doing

Writing scripts to take inventory of customer environments. Financial modelling. All feels very 2021.

## What I’ve been thinking about

Habits - and what's my next nudge? After reading the famous [Atomic Habbits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) I periodically make small adjustments to my daily routines to add in new things I want to do. Most of the time this is things that take me 10-20 minutes a day, like Duolingo or changing my breakfast, other times this is bigger things like buying a treadmill. I'm starting to think about what's list of small changes I want to do and over what time frame. More on this in future weeknotes I think.

## What I’ve been reading

Zero. Well, not quite but my feed has been building up and it's been a lot less reading and a lot more reading of youtube videos as part of my on-going AI learning/research.

Although one thing that sent me off in a bit of a rabbit hole this week is: [Synthesia's AI Avatars](https://www.synthesia.io/avatars).

## What I’ve been watching

* [3 Body Problem](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81024821) (Netflix) - Not the type of sci-fi show you can watch in the background, it really needs watching. It reminds me a bit of Sense8 from a few years ago.

## What I’ve been listening to

New podcast - [Last Week in AI](https://www.lastweekinai.com/) for updates on everything going on in AI world.

## What I’ve been doing in the real world

In [WeekNote-02](https://www.liamjbennett.me/weeknotes/2024-04-12-weeknote-02/) I mentioned I'd just purchased a walking treadmill, well the past couple of weeks have been a bit of an experiment figuring out what types of work I can do a different speeds. Also trying to train my brain to operate and faster and faster speeds (just like I did with podcast listening). I also did some messing about with getting a video background working for Teams. Feel like I'll expand this weeknote update into a full blog post soon.
