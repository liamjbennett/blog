I was on leave again this week and I had planned to spend it doing all the domestic activities that required action but despite a few odd jobs, mostly got distracted by other family activities.

We're spending some time focusing on the house because we're thinking about moving next year. We've lived where we are for almost 10 years now, a lot has happened here and we both feel it's time for a change. Our house currently just sits outside of the town (5 mins drive) and we're looking to move back into the country and get the horses living on our own land. A big ambition and probably typical for the stage of our lives we're in.

I suppose the only activity done this week that's relevant to the usual content I write about on here is that had my first attempt at decluttering my office. That means going through those boxes old cables, old gadgets, empty boxes and draw with books I value. 

Things I learnt re-discovered as a result of this activity:
1) I have too many old hard drives with content I don't need or use any more. Time for some review and backups.
2) No one needs that many USB cables - seriously, you don't!
3) I think my experience with using a mechanical keyboard was a bit of a failure. I used it for about 18-months, it was mostly hated in the house because of it's noise and I really didn't like it as much as my old usb Apple Magic Keyboard. I'll be selling this one off soon. Like all geeks who fall down this rabbit hole, I'll likely re-try this experiment in a couple of years time.
4) I have lots of ebooks that I don't read and only a handful of physical books that I have read cover-to-cover (some several times) these are:
* [The Manager's Path by Camille Fournier](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path)
* [Team Topologies by Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44135420-team-topologies)
* [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps by Gene Kim, Jez Humble, and Nicole Forsgren](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35747076-accelerate)
