Ok, well this week feels like it's been about one thing - the massive RFP. This is definitely going to weeks (if not months), from now on for the sake of clarity I'll be referring to this as Project-R. I can't say much else about it at this stage, so this weeknote is going to be a short one.

My entire week was mostly spent on Project-R. Collaborating with engineers, solutions architects, managed services and starting to write down lots and lots of content.

As a brief interlude I got to have a session with our external finance auditors to discuss intangibles for capitalization (i.e. internal projects we've worked on for service updates) - who says my job it's exciting!
