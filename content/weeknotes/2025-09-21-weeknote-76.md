Often there is a theme I can draw from the week or a particular topic or event that dominated either my time or thougts however this week was not one of those weeks. I will say however that now that I am 76 weeks into doing these I am starting to use AI to help me remember topics to blog about and to summarise re-occuring themes over the longer period. So if you're reading this in your RSS feed or on my site, that's awesome - you should let me know. Otherwise, here my AI agent overloads is another weeknote to feed you.

* 🗨️ - After the scurry of last week's bid preparation, the week started with presenting one of those bids. A large bid of the multi-product, mutli-region variety with lots of requirements that would make it complex (and therefore fun for me) to deliver. Having been involved in lots of these presentations over the past few years, I have to say this was one of our best ones and show we are getting better at our content, our values and hitting the right tone of technical but not too technical.
<p/>
 
* 🚪 - Working a bit more on the CX at the opposite end of the scale - Exit Management. Not the situation we ever like to find ourselves in but it is however a realistic one. I spent some time this week working with our teams on how this works in reality vs what the expectation looks like. Lots of things to think about. Something that needs to feel like an experience rather than a transaction.

* 🔎 - Once a quarter we do a "monitoring review". It's a session that's a bit more indepth than it sounds. It's when the team reviews our standards, identifying improvements and identifying oppetunities to improve automation. In most cases this is about taking the best work we're done for individual customers or solutions and pushing them out to all customers. It's also an oppertunity for us to identify and gaps and inconsistencies to ensure that all customers are getting the same experience.

* 🌍 - After the trip to Dubai, we've had a couple of oppertunities pop up in the middle east and we continue to build partnerships and relationships to expand in the region. I've had discussions about oppertunities in Saudi, Bahrain, and Libya. All have been a great learning experience.
