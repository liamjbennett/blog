The [/colophon](/colophon) page is a page that describes how the site is made, with what tools, supporting what technologies.

## Hosting and deployment

This site uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, hosted on [Github](https://github.com/liamjbennett/blog) and deployed by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Writing

The main writing elements of this site on [/posts](/posts) and [/weeknotes](/weeknotes) are put together in [VSCode]() but often start as ideas/activities in [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/). 

I start with a oneliner whenever an idea strikes me, I let it sit there for a few days/weeks, mostly to see if it still interests me after a while, and it if does then I'll start writing the draft. Now, that draft might also sit there for a while or in the case of some of my posts it might take a couple of weeks to write. But my method is that every week (mostly Sundays) I sit there in front of the tv, write my weeknote and spend a least 30 working on something else on this site. Sometimes that something else, is another page like this one and sometimes it's a draft of a blog post.

## Other pages

There are other pages on this site such as [/links](/links) or [/snippets](/snippets) that are developed in very different way. These are posts that are in th momenent - sharing an interesting bookmark or something I've posted on socail media.

For these posts I use iOS shortcuts and the Working Copy app on my phone. I've shared these shortcuts and the process in a bit more details in [this devlog entry](https://www.liamjbennett.me/devlog/2025-06-06-devlog-02/).
