It has been far too long since I last found myself writing any tl;dr content. Like the vast majority, this is at least my third attempt, my third tool and who know's if it will stick although I am now using the octopress/github setup. I am now writing along side my the rest of my code, so I think that it will be gaining traction that way.

So what I am writing about? Well I am working on so many different things these days: both in work and personally so I thought I would start with some of that. I working in both ruby and java as both developer and ops and I am in the process of open sourcing as much of my work as possible because I want you all to be able to read it and comment on it.

I am also going to be commenting on my day-to-day work and my observations of culture. As such it is worth stating that the opinions I have here on this blog are my opions alone and do not represent the views or values of my current (or for that matter my previous) employer.

<br/>

And with that all taken into consideration lets do this thing â€¦
