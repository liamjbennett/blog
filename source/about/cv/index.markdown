##Employment

###June 2010 - Present: Mimecast Ltd (London) - DevTools Engineer
As a build and release engineer for Mimecast I have worked with all teams within the business and directly with the CTO to introduce Continuous Delivery into the business. This still continues to be my focus as the engineering team grows from 20+ to 100+.

I think a devops mentality is critical to a role like this and I continue to make sure that I remain balanced in both my development and operations skill-sets. This means that I am involved in all aspects of SDLC. I advise on component based architectures to help speed to build/delivery process, I introduce and educate on new testing tools, and I implement and improve of the deployment and release processes. I am also the primary administrator for all pre-production environments both Linux (CentOS) and Windows (all versions) and make extensive use of configuration management (puppet) and monitoring tools (Opsview, Nagios, Munin) to achieve this. I have performed many large migration projects and was heavily involved in Mimecast's ISO 28000:2007 certification.

I am very much platform and language agnostic and work day-day with a wide variety of tools and platforms including Java, C# and Ruby and work with both Linux, Windows and all major mobile platforms. I continue to believe that it is hugely important to remain flexible and to be able to pick up new languages and skills as quickly and efficiently as possible.

###Feb 2009 - June 2010: Saga Holidays Ltd (Folkestone, Kent) - System Consultant
As a systems consultant for Saga Holidays my work was extremely varied from Java development work to advising non-technical business individuals about upcoming ideas and technologies. As a developer I worked on Java systems, both client and server side. I was originally recruited for my swing development skills but extended my knowledge beyond this into unit testing, webservices and databases.

In addition, I found that I spent a considerable amount of time focusing on build and releasing issues. I moved the team from performing manual builds to a semi-automated process and I continued to work on this as they advanced further in the continuous integration maturity model. This has extended my skill set to cover the use of tools such as Jenkins/Hudson, Sonar and scripting technologies such as Ant, Ivy and Maven. This was a difficult process (due in part the then legacy codebase) and required code refactoring, education of other impacted teams and migration to new toolsets (including new SCM).

Saga gave me experience in bringing CI to a large organization and the various challenges both technical and cultural that are involved in that.

###Sept 2006 - Aug 2007: Nexor Ltd (Nottingham) - Placement Student
I had various roles during my year with Nexor as I rotated around a number of departments where I learnt Perl, C++ and a number of Testing and Development skills (including unix development and the use of vmware). I also gained experience in network administration and the implementation and maintenance of military standard email software.

This development experience, in addition to my time in testing, has given me experience of the full software development life-cycle as well as a consideration of everything that is required for ISO:9000 status. During this time I was trained by a external party in the practice of good customer service and I maintain that this is one of my strengths from the year.
