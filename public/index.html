			Winops 2015</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last week I was kindly invited to participate in the first WinOps (<a href="http://winops.org/">http://winops.org/</a>) conference in London.</p>

<p><img src="/images/winops-logo.png" height="200" width="200" align="center"/></p>

<p>I have been skirting around the edges of the microsoft world for some time now and when I saw this conference appear I thought it would be a good opportunity to chat with those individuals whom are fully immersed in windows but may have a different devops journey to my own.</p>

<p>I will be honest, I was fully expecting to walk into a room full of suited business types looking to buy the devops and discuss ROI. Thankfully that trope was only in my own head (aren’t they always!) and I what I really discovered was a group of engineers very like myself but from very different backgrounds.</p>

<p>Most of the attendees were from large enterprises with diverse environments (not all were 100% windows). This meant that they were coming to the discussion with problems like: big legacy systems, enterprise tooling and licensing agreements &ndash; something for which I have up to this point managed to only view from a safe distance. They were also coming from a background of being new to devops and some were still struggling with continuous delivery pipelines. This reminded me that for all the advances that have been made in the devops discussions there are always going to be people who are new so we can’t always make assumptions of knowledge &ndash; something we often do when in a bit of an echo chamber.</p>

<p>I won’t go through all the talks &ndash; they were all fantastic and a great overview of the current state of the universe for windows (thanks Stephen Thair and John Rakowski)</p>

<p>I will point out one however, the talk from JustEat’s Peter Mounce, who discusses their infrastructure and the journey from hand-build machines in their own datacenter to windows servers in AWS that are regularly destroyed. This was a great talk to give to this audience because it demonstrated that even in the world of windows, where the perception is that everything is a little bit more difficult, that things like this are actually possible. I am sure that we (OpenTable) will be looking more and more at this as we to move to the path of trying to destroy more of our infrastructure on a regular basis. (note: I am not going to say immutable here &ndash; more on that some other time)</p>

<p>After these though provoking talks and some more interesting discussion over lunch it was time for me to step up and try and sound like I know what I am talking about.</p>

<p>Firstly I was invited to be a member of the panel discussion Infrastructure as Code. On this panel were representatives of DSC,Chef,Puppet and Ansible. I was there to represent the non-vendor view (my preference towards puppet was made clear). Most of the questions veered towards to more basic IaC principles: Why manage as text files (code)?, Thoughts on SCCM?, Where do I start? I think the most personally interesting part of this panel was that all of the panel members seemed to agree &ndash; something that was unexpected on my part.</p>

<p><img src="/images/winops-2015-01.jpg"/></p>

<p>Next, I was unexpectedly asked to also fill in some space on the CI/CD for Windows panel. This was again about some core principles: deployments and packaging. While this was basic, it’s been a few years since my job has been focused on this so it was good to get back to basics and also being forced into justifying my opinions. We had a great chat about packaging on windows and the options available, as well as how to manage database deployments and orchestration. It’s great to know that there has been a long of work done here in the windows space and it’s all a lot better than when I was going it 2-3 years ago.</p>

<p><img src="/images/winops-2015-02.jpg"/></p>

<p>Over all I found this to be a great little conference with a diverse range of people with lots of challenges. Most of the companies represented might be at the start of their devops journey but there are a lot of passionate people focussed on helping improve this space. Now that microsoft is also embracing this, most of these companies and engineers feel much more comfortable in moving forward. I think it’s going to be an exciting few years ahead for those in the windows world.</p>

<p>Note: you might also want to read this great post from Hannah Foxwell who beat me to it in reviewing:

			[Quick Update] - 23-Mar-2015</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ok, so you’ve seen the date of this post. I’m not exactly as regular with these posts as I would like but it seems that I do in fact still have things to write about.</p>

<h4> Foreman</h4>

<p>One of the big things that I have been working on recently has been in puppetizing the foreman infrastructure used at OpenTable. Thankfully this is quite a mature community and there has already been a lot of work done however one limitation that I found was that I wanted to actually use puppet to configure foreman after I had installed it.</p>

<p>For anyone that has actually spent some time with foreman you will know that entity model is a little complex and it can take a long time to configure with settings specific to your organization. Having a somewhat ageing foreman installation meant that we were suffering from the problems of any aging, snow-flaked system, namely it was flakey and no one wanted to make changes to it. This is when I decided that this was a good opportunity to extend the already existing puppet module to support this entity model with custom types/providers.</p>

<p>This was my first foray into writing types and providers so it took a little longer than might be expected and took several iterations to get the code working and more importantly, performant. Writing types and providers is still one of those areas that I don’t think is a well documented process and is not for the unexperienced. For the majority of my time I had <a href="">this</a> wonder blog open, in addition to <a href="">the book</a> and the <a href="">puppet documentation</a> on the subject. Only with the arsenal of resources available was I able to tackle the challenge. Thankfully a couple of weeks of hacking later and I managed to have types for all the major foreman components: operatingsystems, configuration templates, provisioning profiles etc.</p>

<p>Take a look at my work and see what you think &hellip;</p>

<h4>puppet-community</h4>

<p>Puppet community is a github organization that has been developing for some time now. The idea behind the project/community is provide a shared space for puppet modules to live and be developed. It’s key benefits are really just starting to develop but are quite useful &ndash; shared build scripts, shared testing infrastructure and shared development and PR management. The hope is that with the experience that is found in the community the quality of the modules in the community as a whole will increase.</p>

<p>Being a separate non-corporate, non-individual entity means that when a primary author moves organizations and/or does not have the time to work on a module any more they have people who will continue to support it. This is huge, as anyone who has any more than about 5 modules on the forge will tell you &ndash; managing PRs and releasing updates can become a big job pretty fast. I know there are 8 modules authored by me personally and over 10 authored by myself and my OpenTable colleagues &ndash; this was becoming a full time job.</p>

<p>As you might be able to assume by this point, I am a huge fan of the project and I have been moving both my own personal modules as well as a number of OpenTable modules into the community. I won’t discuss this aspect any further, because there will be a much larger post of the subject &ndash; but be assured, it’s very exciting and a good move for all the users of all the modules I have written.</p>

<h4>puppet notes</h4>

<p>Finally anther small thing I have been working on is externalizing the notes I have been keeping about puppet over the last couple of years.  These notes over everything from weird edge-cases you might run into, certain style guides and by far the largest part of the notes is on different code patterns I have been and my comments on them. As you might expect there is lots of content in there on several different approaches to the same problem &ndash; I have been doing my best to document these, including when I think they can be used and trying to pick a favourite.  I’d love for you to take a look and let me know your thoughts.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Hopefully by now you are not too bored and have found some interesting things. In which case you should absolutely reach out to be at <a href="https://twitter.com/liamjbennett">@liamjbennett</a> and let me know your thoughts.</p>

<p>Until next time …..</p>

			[Quick Update] - 12-Mar-2015</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It has recently been commented by a few individuals that I am a poor communicator of some of the interesting things that I am usually hacking on. I guess they are right and I thought that rather than wait and do a big-bang style blog post of the usual multi-thousand word variety that I would start trying to write these little posts in about 30 minutes and see how that works out. By the time your reading this I will have likely already written several and managed to build up a least a little motivation in writing again.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>With all that in mind, what have I actually been working on recently?</p>

<h4>The slow road towards linux on the desktop</h4>

<p>Like almost all of my peers, it seems that for a number of years now I have been spending 40+ hours a week curled up with my macbook only to be dissatisfied with the operating system that it comes with. I have already seen a number people start to make the transition to Linux or BSD on the desktop and I think that 2015 might be the year for me (if you’re reading this after 2015 &ndash; don’t laugh too hard because I really meant it). With that target in mind I have been spending some time reducing my tooling to only those things that are cross-platform, preferring the command-line and making a note of all those things that I might have to keep OS X around for. So far in the past few months I have changed my password manager (1password to lastpass) my editor (atom to tmux+vim) and made a good list of things I like on OS X (RoyalTSX and VMware fusion) none of which seems to be blocking my transition. I am sure that this little project might turn into one of those big-bang blogs &ndash; but don’t hold your breath ;)</p>

<h4>A few more updates with testing puppet on windows</h4>

<p>So I wrote (this) post a while back and I have continue to work on the project and getting the changes that need to made into the master branch of beaker for everyone to use easily. This is almost done now so over the next few weeks you should be able to really start testing those modules &ndash; with our packer images of course.</p>

<h4>Updates to those packer images</h4>

<p>From the download numbers it seems like a number of your like using those windows images that I created so I am very happy about that. If you go and take another look at the page on atlas you should see that there a number of new versions there now that you might want to play with. We unfortunately had to temporally close-source the packer templates behind those images while we dealt with an issue with the bitvise installation, although expect this to be open again very soon. In addition to that I am very excited with the things going on over at the packer-community project. It seems like the plugins are now there so that we will eventually be able to remove the bitvise dependency completely, which is exciting.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Ok, so that’s enough for this first 30-minute update, but don’t worry I have plenty more updates to come in the following days so stay tuned for that.</p>
